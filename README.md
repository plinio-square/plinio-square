- 👋 Hi, I’m Plinio! (plinio). I'm the EM for Mobile Payment Experience, which owns Reader SDK, In-App Payments, and Point of Sale API.
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile development, engineering managing, baking and making music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ASL!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to make your life easier, by using Reader SDK 2 to delegate all payments to our team, so you can focus on what matters to you.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'm plinio @ Slack.
